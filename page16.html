                <p>Your head is lowered so no one can see your expression.</p>
                <p>“Well?” The girl growls.</p>
                <p>“It’s too late.” The girl stumbles backwards as you raise your head. On your face is a big smile.</p>
                <p>“I’ve already called the cavalry.”</p>
                <p>“OI YV3L! You didn’t tell me anything you idiot!” A girl you know very well jumps through a white portal that had formed behind you, shooting a magical beam that disarms the blue haired girl in front of you.</p>
                <p>“Didn’t think you’d come Wen- I mean, Magical Girl Hero.” You cough down the laugh that was about to escape.</p>
                <p>“Shut up! Shut up!” She hisses. Your good friend Wendel was actually the white-hat named Magical Girl Hero, known for saving people and serving justice to her foes. She recently pieced together your night activities and you knew she’d come when you sent the SOS.</p>
                <p>“Don’t count me out.” A skateboard shoots out of the portal next and slams a couple of the black-hats to the ground. Soon enough, Magical Girl Hero and the skateboarder- Syme- are fighting off the black-hats.</p>
                <p>“Really? Naming yourself off your cat’s name?” You shout to Syme, aka Lucas.</p>
                <p>“Shut up!” He says, mirroring Wendel.</p>
                <p>“YV3L is not much better! It’s so lame!”</p>
                <p>“Art is an explosion!” Cuts in Grey whose code name is Grey. Why he didn’t change his name, you have no clue. His vampire-like wings open as he flies, throwing down apples that explode the enemies.</p>
                <p>“Ugh, retreat!” The blue haired girl cries and some of the hackers escape. You sigh and regroup with the gang.</p>
                <p>“And this is why we don’t do vigilante activities.” Wendel says, bonking you on the head.</p>
                <p>“Sorry…”</p>
                <p>“You should be. Now let’s get out of here.”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>So, Yuu Chu became a white-hat instead. In the day, you work a normal job with your friend Wendel. At night, you are YOON, part of the Four Clovers. You hid the fact that you are The Admin and do good deeds with your friends. This group of white-hats grew to become the best heroes the VV has ever seen.</p>
