                <p>“I’m thinking of specializing in cybersecurity actually.” You decide.</p>
                <p>“Huh, not that I didn’t expect that. You did help me code my project to be secure that one time. I was so sure all the databases would be leaked in test #35.” Wendel nods.</p>
                <p>“Aww I was so sure you’d join us in art.” Lucas sighs.</p>
                <p>“Whatever, we’re glad you’re doing what makes you happy.” He smiles. Grey nods enthusiastically while spouting some poetry.</p>
                <p>Your phone starts ringing, and you excuse yourself to listen. The second you step outside the café and answer the phone your environment changes. You curse as you realize a program was activated, sending you into the VV.</p>
                <p>“Hello YV3L. Or should I say Admin?”</p>
                <p>You blink in confusion at the blue-haired girl in front of you. But are instantly tense and wary.</p>
                <p>The Admin. Known for creating VirtualVerse and the type conversion algorithm able to take in real-life data and output virtual-life data. They are the only person who knows VV inside and out- able to use any script and command that even the best hackers are unaware of. All known information about them was deleted after the VV was created. One side worship this unknown deity while the other curses the person who created this godforsaken virtual world. No one should have known you were The Admin…</p>
                <p>“Give us the data. I won’t say it again.” She smirks.</p>
                <p>“You’re from Hologram, I presume?” You reply, looking warily around. It seems like there’s a bunch of other people surrounding you.</p>
                <p>The girl pulls out a gun and aims it at your head with a sadistic grin. You tense.</p>
                <p>“Give it to me or you die. This gun has a script that will terminate you out of existence- from here and in the real world. Also don’t think you can just code your way out; we’ve got plenty of black-hats here wanting to get rid of YV3L and The Admin. You’re surrounded.”</p>
                <p>Behind the girl, you see people emerging from the shadows, some scowling in hatred while others seem excited to have you gone.</p>
                <p>“…”</p>
