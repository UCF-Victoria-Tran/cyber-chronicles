                <p>“I’m… actually thinking of dropping out.” You decide.</p>
                <p>“Really? Are you sure?” Wendel looks worried.</p>
                <p>“Don’t worry, I have a plan.” You look determinedly at the three of them. They all nod.</p>
                <p>“We trust you. Go and do whatever I guess.” Lucas laughs.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>So, Yuu Chu drops out of college and pursues a different route. After giving the data to Hologram Corp, you apply to become a virtual idol for their company. You become known as the hacker idol and vartist, Yoon. Though you are busy and don’t have a lot of time in the real world, you get to do all the things that make you happy- coding and drawing- while changing the horrible society within the VV. Yoon becomes the top virtual idol with millions of fans worldwide. You save the VV for the better.</p>
