                <p><i>“I should probably go meet them. The only sus things are meeting them in an alleyway in the real and they know my true identity… Well, that’s really sus but they might spread my identity if I don’t go.”</i> You think logically.</p>
                <p>The alleyway is close by. Soon enough, you step into the shady alleyway and see a person leaning against the wall. He’s wearing a suit and fedora cap.</p>
                <p>“You YV3L? Or should I say Admin?” The guy smirks. He looks down at you and you can’t help but notice the strange tattoos on his face. Some kind of triangle symbol on his left cheek. He has the Hologram Corp logo clipped to his tie.</p>
                <p>“Yeah. That’s me.”</p>
                <p>“Didn’t expect a little girl. Well, whatever. Doesn’t matter if you’re some prodigy. You’re going to give me the data, girl.”</p>
                <p>The man suddenly grabs your arm, and your surroundings change. His virtual gloves sent the both of you into the VV. Now the guy looks a bit different, having transformed to his VV avatar. You blink in confusion at the blue-haired girl in front of you. </p>
                <p>“Didn’t expect a little girl.” You echo the guy's- well girl's now- words.</p>
                <p>“Shut up. I’m an idol.”</p>
                <p>The girl pulls out a gun and aims it at your head with a sadistic grin. You tense.</p>
                <p>“Give it to me or you die. This gun has a script that will terminate you out of existence- from here and in the real world. Also don’t think you can just code your way out; we’ve got plenty of black-hats here wanting to get rid of YV3L and The Admin. You’re surrounded.”</p>
                <p>Behind the girl, you see people emerging from the shadows, some scowling in hatred while others seem excited to have you gone.</p>
                <p>“…”</p>
