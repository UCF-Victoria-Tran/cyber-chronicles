                <p>Shrugging your shoulders, you decide to take the left path. Walking with the slow-moving binary text, you tense when you see the path opens to a large circular room. You pause in your step when you realize you had stepped on a faint trip wire. You lost the 50/50…</p>
                <p>“Stop right there!” From the other side of the room, you see two security officers rushing forward.</p>
                <p>With the way ahead of you blocked, you turn around only to see the hallway disappearing. Looks like the termination sequence activated. Thinking fast, you open VV’s command prompt with a swipe of your wrist. </p>
                <p><b>“Loading: Escape Sequence #22…”</b> A robotic voice says. Waving mockingly at the officers, you teleport away from the scene. Opening your eyes, you see the white ceiling of your room. </p>
                <p>This is your room, the room of Yuu Chu. Average college student studying computer science with a hobby of drawing. Definitely not a sus person with time to log into VV at night to hack into corporate databases…</p>
                <p>Checking your phone, you see your failsafe cybersecurity sequences activating, preventing potential hackers from seeing your logout.</p>
                <p><i>“I managed to get away.”</i> You think to yourself.</p>
                <p><i>“Sadly, my 100% not-getting-seen percentage is going to take a hit…”</i></p>
                <p>You get up from your bed to make yourself a simple dinner. Cup noodles. Your night job manages to pay off tuition and housing, but due to the intensity you barely have enough time to eat. You inhale the noodles in no time.</p>
                <p>Sighing, you take the flash drive out of your pocket and examine it.</p>
                <p><i>“I should probably look at the data and see if I got all of it…”</i> Glancing at the time, you realize it is later than you thought it would be. Worse yet, the sun has already risen.</p>
                <p><i>“I only have four hours till class… On second thought, should I do my homework?”</i> You look towards your somewhat messy desk.</p>
                <p><i>“What was the assignment again? Ugh. Maybe I should just lie down.”</i></p>
