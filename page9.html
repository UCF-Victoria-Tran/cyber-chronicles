                <p><i>“I just got back from the VV, might as well take a quick rest- by that I mean clicking through aimless videos on my phone.”</i> You think with a nod.</p>
                <p>As you scroll past yet another cute kitten video, your notifications annoy you so much that you can’t ignore them anymore. </p>
                <p><i>“Hey Yuu! Just wanted to let you know that the programming assignment is due soon so don’t slack off on it! I know you have probably not started but please at least get this done.”</i> Is a message from your friend Wendel, a fellow computer science student and your best friend. Wendel is strict sometimes, but she’s a smart and kind friend. Maybe a bit too smart sometimes, she’s onto your streak of missed assignments… </p>
                <p><i>“xXxIDolM@st3rxXx has followed you.”</i> Is the next notification from your social media. You notice that more and more people are getting interested in your art. Maybe you should finally finish that piece you’ve been working on.</p>
                <p><i>“Hello YV3L. Please send us the data as soon as possible.”</i> Is the last message. Maybe you should check the data that you collected from the job to make sure you have everything. That way the job will be done, and you’ll get the dough…</p>
                <p><i>“What should I prioritize here?” </i></p>
