                <p><i>“I might as well finish my drawing; it’s almost done anyways.”</i> You decide.</p>
                <p>Getting out your drawing tablet, you attach it to your computer. Spinning the stylus on your finger, you get to work.</p>
                <p>“Just one last edit here… and it’s done.” You say aloud in triumph.</p>
                <p>Stretching your arms out, you double take at the time.</p>
                <p>“It’s already time for class?! Uh oh, I’m late!” You scurry to pack everything and rush out the door.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>—time skip—</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>“-And that’s it for class. Don’t forget that the next assignment is due next week! If you have any questions, then walk with me. I’m almost late for the next class…” Your professor speeds out the door with a swarm of students following him- like usual. Some are enamored by his good looks while the others genuinely have questions.</p>
                <p>You take out your phone as you walk out, ignoring everyone grouping up and asking how the others did on the pop quiz.</p>
                <p><i>"I should have studied or something instead of drawing..."</i> You think to yourself.</p>
                <p>Playing some random watermelon game, you head home to take a short nap. When you wake up, you realize it’s been a couple hours. Checking your texts, you see your friend Wendel contacting you.</p>
                <p><i>“We’re all at Café Vinyl so if you want to join us, we’ll be here for a couple hours.”</i> It reads from 15 minutes ago.</p>
                <p><i>“They do have really cute and delicious parfaits…”</i> You think longingly.</p>
                <p><i>“But on second thought I got to go home and check the flash drive’s data. Who knows how long the client will give me. I can’t keep delaying it.”</i></p>
