                <p><i>“Wendel will get mad at me if I don’t finish the assignment, so I’ll just do that right now.”</i> You sigh, switching to your coding IDE and typing at light speed.</p>
                <p>After a couple of hours where all that can be heard is the clicking of keycaps, you finish the assignment. You submit it with five minutes to spare.</p>
                <p>“Nice. I’m glad the professor has the due date 10 minutes before class starts. Finished with enough time to make it to class early.” You say, grabbing your bag. </p>
                <p>You hiss at the bright sunlight when you open the door. Sighing, you drag your feet to your college campus.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>—time skip—</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>“-And that’s it for class. Don’t forget that the next assignment is due next week! If you have any questions, then walk with me. I’m almost late for the next class…” Your professor speeds out the door with a swarm of students following him- like usual. Some are enamored by his good looks while the others genuinely have questions.</p>
                <p>You take out your phone as you walk out. Playing some random watermelon game, you head home to take a short nap. When you wake up, you realize it’s been a couple hours. Checking your texts, you see your friend Wendel contacting you.</p>
                <p><i>“We’re all at Café Vinyl so if you want to join us, we’ll be here for a couple hours.”</i> It reads from 15 minutes ago.</p>
                <p><i>“They do have really cute and delicious parfaits…”</i> You think longingly.</p>
                <p><i>“But on second thought I got to go home and check the flash drive’s data. Who knows how long the client will give me. I can’t keep delaying it.”</i></p>
