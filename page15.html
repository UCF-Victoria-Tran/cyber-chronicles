                <p>Your head is lowered so no one can see your expression.</p>
                <p>“Well?” The girl growls.</p>
                <p>“When I created the VV, I didn’t think it would become so corrupted with people like you.” When you raise your head there’s a more twisted expression than the girl in front of you. You grab the gun, and the blue haired girl cries out when you twist her arm. You throw the gun on the ground in front of you and activate a script that prevents anyone from moving.</p>
                <p>“This world has been poisoned by greedy, selfish, malicious, sinful people. It must be cleansed by the hand from which gave it birth.” Your eyes are soulless, and it is almost like you see the people in front of you as objects. </p>
                <p>“Goodbye.” Raising a hand, you activate deletion sequences to wipe all the players from the board. Standing in the dark room with a spotlight over your head and bits of code floating around you, you laugh.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>So, Yuu Chu disappeared from the real world. Most think you died but no one truly knows what really happened. The virtual world changed, for better or worse. The Admin reappeared and took control of VV. Some respect and follow you as crime rates were reduced and the VV became a whole lot safer. Others curse your existence as they are reduced to slaves under your control, thrown to rot in virtual jail for seemingly petty crimes. </p>
