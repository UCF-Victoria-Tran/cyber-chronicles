                <p><i>“I should probably go check the programming assignment…”</i> You think, trudging over to your desk.</p>
                <p>Turning on your computer, you are blasted with so many open tabs. Your holographic screen splits into six monitors so you can play that random YouTube music video that’s been stuck in your head, open your emails, check your calendar, run that one gatcha game you mentioned earlier to do dailies, move a digital drawing you had open, and finally check the programming assignment.</p>
                <p>As a computer science student, you are advised to start early on all programming assignments as they are time consuming and often, you’ll reach errors that you will have a hard time debugging. Due to the time constraints with your night job, you open the IDE to find you had only written a couple comments on the skeleton code.</p>
                <p><i>“Thank you, past Yuu…”</i> You cry on the inside.</p>
                <p>Glancing at another one of the open tabs, you remember you were working on an art piece for your social media sites. It’s about half done, with the line art and base coloring completed. The character’s star-like eyes and weird bunny accessory are the only things rendered right now.</p>
                <p><i>“I need to get my homework done but doing a little drawing first won’t hurt, right? I’ve had this piece unfinished for almost two weeks now…”</i> You think.</p>
                <p><i>“But on second thought, those hands look weird so I might redo the line art… Which could take a while.”</i></p>
