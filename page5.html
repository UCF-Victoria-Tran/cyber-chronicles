                <p>“Checking the data it is…” You grumble. You know you aren’t a sloppy hacker but just in case there was a failsafe in the data itself… Taking your phone out of your pocket, you plug in your flash drive. Reading the files quickly with your glasses in scanning mode, you conclude that nothing is amiss. </p>
                <p>When you unplug the flash drive, your phone suddenly rings.</p>
                <p>*RING RING RING*</p>
                <p>“…Hello?”</p>
                <p>“Hello Ms. Admin.”</p>
                <p>“!?”</p>
                <p>“This is Hologram Corp. We ask you to meet us at the first alleyway by Vivid Street. We have sent the address by email. Please bring the data. Goodbye.”</p>
                <p>*beep beep beep*</p>
                <p>“…”</p>
                <p>The Admin. Known for creating VirtualVerse and the type conversion algorithm able to take in real-life data and output virtual-life data. They are the only person who knows VV inside and out- able to use any script and command that even the best hackers are unaware of. All known information about them was deleted after the VV was created. One side worship this unknown deity while the other curses the person who created this godforsaken virtual world. No one should have known you were The Admin…</p>
                <p><i>“Should I go meet them? Ask them how they know who I am? Or is this a trap?”</i> You think solemnly. </p>
