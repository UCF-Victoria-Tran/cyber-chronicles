                <p>“I’m going to switch to art.” You decide.</p>
                <p>“I knew it! Art is the way to go. You’ll love it.” Lucas smiles.</p>
                <p>“Yes! Your art is going to be great!” Grey laughs, knocking shoulders with you in glee.</p>
                <p>“Well, whatever you decide. Just make sure you do your work.” Wendel says, sighing.</p>

                <p>So, Yuu Chu switched her major to Studio Art and graduated successfully from college. You worked hard to increase your follower accounts on your social media and managed to get a good following. You have fun collaborating with your art friends and get so many commissions for your art. As for your job as YV3L, you handed the data off to Hologram Corp and deleted your account. You never went back to the VV and could only watch as it descended into a world of madness and evil.</p>
