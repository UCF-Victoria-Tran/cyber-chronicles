                <p><i>“This whole thing is so sus… I’ll just stay at home.”</i> You decide. You go to delete the email with the address. But then you hear a strange noise.</p>
                <p>*CLICK*</p>
                <p>“!!”</p>
                <p>There’s a guy in your house. He’s wearing a suit and fedora cap.</p>
                <p>“You YV3L? Or should I say Admin?” The guy smirks. He looks down at you and you can’t help but notice the strange tattoos on his face. Some kind of triangle symbol on his left cheek. He has the Hologram Corp logo clipped to his tie.</p>
                <p>“How’d you get in here? Get out!” You growl. </p>
                <p>“Didn’t expect a little girl. Well, whatever. Doesn’t matter if you’re some prodigy. You’re going to give me the data, girl.”</p>
                <p>The man suddenly grabs your arm, and your surroundings change. His virtual gloves sent the both of you into the VV. Now the guy looks a bit different, having transformed to his VV avatar. You blink in confusion at the blue-haired girl in front of you. </p>
                <p>“Didn’t expect a little girl.”</p>
                <p>“Shut up. I’m an idol.”</p>
                <p>The girl pulls out a gun and aims it at your head with a sadistic grin. You tense.</p>
                <p>“Give it to me or you die. This gun has a script that will terminate you out of existence- from here and in the real world. Also don’t think you can just code your way out; we’ve got plenty of black-hats here wanting to get rid of YV3L and The Admin. You’re surrounded.”</p>
                <p>Behind the girl, you see people emerging from the shadows, some scowling in hatred while others seem excited to have you gone.</p>
                <p>“…”</p>
