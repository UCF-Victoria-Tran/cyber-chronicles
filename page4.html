                <p>With a nod, you decide to take the right path. Walking with the slow-moving binary text, you sigh in relief when the room widens to show a regular, computer-filled office. You apparently won the 50/50. If only this could happen in the game…</p>
                <p>Pushing open the glass double doors, you’re outside of the building. You take a second to leave a comment on their source code with your name on it before opening VV’s command prompt.</p>
                <p><b>“Loading: Logout Sequence…”</b></p>
                <p>Opening your eyes, you see the white ceiling of your room. This is your room, the room of Yuu Chu. Average college student studying computer science with a hobby of drawing. Definitely not a sus person with time to log into VV at night to hack into corporate databases…</p>
                <p>Checking your phone, you see your failsafe cybersecurity sequences activating, preventing potential hackers from seeing your logout.</p>
                <p><i>“I call that a successful heist.”</i> You think to yourself with a smile.</p>
                <p>You get up from your bed to make yourself a simple dinner. Cup noodles. Your night job manages to pay off tuition and housing, but due to the intensity you barely have enough time to eat. You inhale the noodles in no time.</p>
                <p>Sighing, you take the flash drive out of your pocket and examine it.</p>
                <p><i>“I should probably look at the data and see if I got all of it…”</i> Glancing at the time, you realize it is later than you thought it would be. Worse yet, the sun has already risen.</p>
                <p><i>“I only have four hours till class… On second thought, should I do my homework?”</i> You look towards your somewhat messy desk.</p>
                <p><i>“What was the assignment again? Ugh. Maybe I should just lie down.”</i></p>
