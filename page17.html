                <p>“I’m going to continue with computer science.” You decide.</p>
                <p>“I knew you’d make the right decision.” Wendel smiles.</p>
                <p>“Aww, I thought you’d choose art. Whatever makes you happy.” Lucas sighs.</p>

                <p>So, Yuu Chu pursued her computer science degree and graduated successfully from college. You continued to get a normal software engineering job working at the same company as your friend Wendel. As for your job as YV3L, you handed the data off to Hologram Corp and deleted your account. You never went back to the VV and could only watch as it descended into a world of madness and evil.</p>
