                <p>Since the first digital world was invented in Reverse 1999, Virtual Reality, or VR for short, has evolved into a whole new world called VirtualVerse (VV), where you can do anything, become anyone, go anywhere. The real world and virtual world have split into two separate entities. It’s completely normal to see flying creatures, magical abilities shooting through the air, and gang fights over digital territory all in one alleyway. It’s VR- we’re free of our earthly shackles. </p>
                <p>Hackers are this world’s heroes, villains, and rulers. White-hat hackers are the heroes. They protect people’s security and neutralize threats. Often, they only do so for fame or fortune but there are a couple of chivalrous ones out there. Black-hat hackers are the villains. Most of the known black-hats have bounties- which they hack to show off their abilities- and perform cyber-attacks with malicious intents. Lastly there’s the in-between, gray-hats. Most are available for hire and operate from their personal manifestos, which are not always ethical. All keep their knowledge of the VV’s code a secret. After all, programmers who are skilled at rewriting the World Code to their advantage rule this world.</p>
                <p>You are a skilled hacker, a gray-hat by the code name YV3L. Rumors are that you are one if not the best hacker-for-hire. Your job completion success rate is 100%. Though no one has ever seen your face or even traces of your coding presence, just based off the little sign you intentionally leave. You take any job that doesn’t involve killing, which juxtaposes your name- evil. Many people think of you as a vigilante. </p>
                <p>You are currently on another job, helping Hologram Corp, an idol corporation, hack into a competitor. You think they’re called Rainbow Inc or something. Their rainbow-colored mascot stares at you with soulless eyes as you enter the virtual building. You use a cheat code to glitch to their main database. After collecting the data and storing it into your flash drive, you turn around. You startle a bit, realizing that their cybersecurity system had a failsafe you forgot to inactivate. The single hallway you just passed through has now branched into two paths, both identical.</p>
                <p>“… Great. A 50/50 chance is just like those gatcha games I used to play… Which way do I choose?” You murmur to yourself.</p>
