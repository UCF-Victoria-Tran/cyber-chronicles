                <p>My target audience is anyone who is affected by technology and college students who are lost in what to pursue for their future careers. I used the theme "Implications of Technology" to build a dystopian world in which virtual reality has become another world riddled with cyber crimes. College students such as myself have grown up and/or have experience in using technology and software. In addition, I exploited what every college student is concerned about: our future careers. Since I myself have had questions as to what major to pursue and if I will get a job in the future, I compiled those thoughts into an immersive plotline.</p>
