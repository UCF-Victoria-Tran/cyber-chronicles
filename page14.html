                <p>Your head is lowered so no one can see your expression.</p>
                <p>“Well?” The girl growls.</p>
                <p>“Here’s the data.” You throw your bag towards the girl and when you raise your head, there’s a calm expression on your face.</p>
                <p>“I expected you to do this. These people surround me, they’re employees at your company, aren’t they?” The light turns on, revealing a regular office with a bunch of girls in idol outfits. They looked embarrassed to be acting in such a way.</p>
                <p>“Hah, you got it.” The blue haired girl sighs, throwing away the gun which looked as if it was made with paper mâché in the new lighting.</p>
                <p>“I was going to give you the data anyways. It would look bad on my record if I failed a job, right?” You grin.</p>
                <p>“The thrill of danger and rush of adrenaline whenever I do a job as YV3L… I wouldn’t give it up for the world.”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>So, Yuu Chu juggled a normal job in addition to her night activities as YV3L. You continued to live a two-faced life, always having to hide your true occupation from her friends, family, and coworkers. However, you continued to do good as the vigilante YV3L, trying your best to survive the dangerous virtual world you created. </p>
