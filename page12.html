                <p><i>“I haven’t seen Wendel in ages. Plus, I can make her pay for food.”</i> You think.</p>
                <p>Grabbing your stuff, you head towards Café Vinyl. Pushing open the double doors, you see Wendel and a couple of other friends at a booth by the corner. You sit down beside Wendel.</p>
                <p>“Hey Yuu. Glad you made it. I know that you want one of those strawberry parfaits, so I ordered one.” Wendel says, adjusting her glasses. She always acts so cooly but only you know her secretly girly side. She probably had a bunch of desserts before you got here. You grin as the parfait is placed before you. Soon enough, it’s already gone.</p>
                <p>“We haven’t seen you in a while. Thought you were dead.” Lucas comments dryly, getting off his phone and tucking his hands into his hoodie. Why he always wore that same hoodie was unknown to you. Though, you couldn’t judge since you barely had time to do laundry yourself.</p>
                <p>“I post stuff on my story though. You just never check since you’re always in the art room painting your cat on the walls.” You roll your eyes. </p>
                <p>“I can draw whatever I want.” He grumbles.</p>
                <p>“Yes, art is whatever you want it to be.” Grey adds in. He’s a strange fellow who has extremely pale skin, always wears black and frilly clothing, and is an art major. So weird. You have no idea how the chill Lucas and passionate Grey are friends. Maybe their shared love of cats?</p>
                <p>“Anyways, I called you here because I have noticed your string of missed programming assignments. I know that you are very good at programming so why?” Wendel buts in with a frown.</p>
                <p>“Do you not like computer science?”</p>
                <p>“Well… it’s…” You murmur.</p>
                <p>“Yeah, maybe you should switch to art like me if you like it more. I know how much time you spend on those drawings of yours.” Lucas adds. </p>
                <p>“Yes, your art is like an explosion.” Grey adds helpfully.</p>
                <p>“Well, I like computer science and art… Sometimes it’s hard to choose between all of them.” You reply with a laugh.</p>
                <p>“I think you should decide on one of them. That way you won’t have so many split priorities.” Wendel decides.</p>
                <p>“So, what do you plan to pursue in the future?”</p>
